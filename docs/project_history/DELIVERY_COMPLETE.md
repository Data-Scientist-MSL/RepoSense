## KEY DECISIONS LOCKED

### ✅ Architecture
- Single source of truth: `.reposense/` storage model
- Convergent backbone: ChatBot + Reports + Diagrams share RunGraph
- Immutable runs: Each run is timestamped, reproducible, auditable

### ✅ Timeline
- Sprint 0 (Week 1): Contracts locked
- Sprints 1-8 (Weeks 2-10): Implementation to shipped
- Delivery date: Friday March 15, 2026

### ✅ Team Structure
- Backend (40h/week): Core infrastructure + services
- Frontend (40h/week): UI panels + visualization
- DevOps (20h/week): Infrastructure + CI/CD
- Tech Lead (15h/week): Coordination + decisions

### ✅ Quality Standards
- Zero TypeScript errors (strict mode)
- >75% test coverage (minimum)
- Definition of done on every PR
- 2+ code reviews required
- No exceptions to quality gates

### ✅ Governance
- Daily standups (9:30 AM, 15 min)
- Sprint reviews (Friday 4 PM, 1 hr)
- Retros (Friday 4:45 PM, 30 min)
- Backlog refinement (Friday 5:30 PM, 30 min)
- No scope changes mid-sprint

---

## CONFIDENCE LEVEL: VERY HIGH ✅

**Why?**
- ✅ Clear architecture locked (no "should we use...?" questions)
- ✅ Detailed execution plan (day-by-day tasks, roles, acceptance criteria)
- ✅ Production code ready to build on (0 compilation errors)
- ✅ Team alignment documents prepared (role-specific reads)
- ✅ Risk mitigation strategy in place (6 identified risks + contingencies)
- ✅ Support structures defined (escalation, communication, getting help)
- ✅ Success metrics clear (demo scripts, exit criteria per sprint)
- ✅ Investment justified ($250K for 10-week delivery to shipped product)

---

## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

**What You're Building**:
> A diagnostic engine that turns code analysis into **provable, auditable evidence**

**Why It Matters**:
- ✅ Not just "found issues" → But "here's proof"
- ✅ Not just "tests needed" → But "here are the tests"
- ✅ Not just "gaps exist" → But "here's how to fix them"
- ✅ Not just "reports" → But "immutable audit trail"

**Market Position**:
- Copilot: Code generation (no proof)
- ESLint/SonarQube: Static analysis (disconnected)
- Jest/Istanbul: Test runners (incomplete coverage)
- RepoSense: **Complete chain** (gap → test → fix → proof)

---
